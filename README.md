**MixTheme base theme for the Mixology suite**

This is a base theme for the Mixology suite.
It uses sass with the [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) 
and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) libraries
for styling.

**Developer Info**

By default, the sass code expects the bourbon and neat
libraries to be installed in `[drupal root]/libraries/sass`.
If you need to change the installation location,
update the `_init.scss` file.

If you are merely installing this theme and are not
updating the code, you do not need to install bourbon or
neat.
